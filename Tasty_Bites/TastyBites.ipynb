    "Tasty Bytes was founded in 2020 in the midst of the Covid Pandemic. The world wanted inspiration so we decided to provide it. We started life as a search engine for recipes, helping people to find ways to use up the limited supplies they had at home.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, over two years on, we are a fully fledged business. For a monthly subscription we will put together a full meal plan to ensure you and your family are getting a healthy, balanced diet whatever your budget. Subscribe to our premium plan and we will also deliver the ingredients to your door.\n",

    "<i><q>They want us to predict which recipes will be popular 80% of the time and minimize the chance of showing unpopular recipes. I don’t think that is realistic in the time we have, but do your best and present what ever you find.</q><i>\n",

    "\n",
    "<i><q>At the moment, I choose my favorite recipe from a selection and display that on the home page. We have noticed that traffic to the rest of the website goes up by as much as 40% if I pick a popular recipe. But I don’t know how to decide if a recipe will be popular. More traffic means more subscriptions so this is really important to the company.</q></i>\n",
