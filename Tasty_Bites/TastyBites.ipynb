    "# Data Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 947 rows and 8 columns in the original data. The data is tidy, i.e. each row is a sample and each column is a feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Duplicate samples\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row of the data has a unique recipe number which implies there are no duplicates. However, I checked for cases where duplicates might exist with different recipe numbers. Two types of these duplicates were investigated:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. all but recipe columns (ABRC) - samples are considered to be duplicates when they have the same values in all but the `recipe` column of the original data.\n",
    "2. calories, carbohydrate, sugar, and protein (CCSP) columns - samples are considered to be duplicates when they have the same calories, carbohydrate, sugar, and protein values.\n",
    "\n",
    "All ABRC duplicates were also found to be CCSP duplicates, In other words, the missing `calories`, `carbohydrate`, `sugar`, and `protein` values are the only columns driving these two types of duplicate record counts. Since there were no duplicate records in the samples that had no missing values and this represents about 94.5% of the data, I assumed that each value in the the recipe column does indeed represent a unique recipe which implies no duplicates exist in the data with missing values as well. **In summary, there are no duplicate records in the data.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## How each column was preprocessed\n",
    "\n",
    "Columns are described and processed as follows:\n",
    "+ **recipe**: This is a number that identifies each recipe.\n",
    "  + This is neither a predictor or target variable.\n",
    "  + It's only purpose is as an identifier.\n",
    "  + There are no missing values.\n",
    "  + <font color=\"green\">No cleaning is needed.</font>\n",
    "+ **calories**, **carbohydrate**, **sugar**, **protein** (CCSP): These are calories, grams of carbohydrates, grams of sugar and grams of protein respectively.\n",
    "  + These are quantitative independent or predictor variables.\n",
    "  + There are 376 of these values that are inconsistent because they show more calories from carb's, sugar and protien combined than the total calories. This effects about 40% of the samples.\n",
    "  + It is not known whether `calories` are too low or if `carbohydrate`, `sugar`, and/or `protein` are too high. I assumed that `calories` values are incorrect and dropped this feature. I futher assume that the other three features are correct and kept them in the analysis.\n",
    "  + The example recipe (tomato soup) specifies that each of these quantities are ***(per serving)***, so it is assumed that each of these values are reported **per serving** as defined by the [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/food/nutrition-facts-label/serving-size-nutrition-facts-label).\n",
    "  + Except for the inconsistent samples, these values appear to fall within reasonable ranges.\n",
    "  + Besides the target (which will be discussed later), these are the only columns that have missing values.\n",
    "  + These values go missing as a group. When any one of these 4 is missing, the other 3 are missing as well.\n",
    "  + Samples with missing values make up 5.5% (52 out of 947) of the data. This proportion is not quite low enough to justify dropping them, so these values were imputed.\n",
    "  + Since the available evidence suggest that these values are **Missing at Random (MAR)**, a linear regression model is used to impute the `carbohydrate`, `sugar`, and `protein` missing values.\n",
    "  + Because the distribution of the `carbohydrate`, `sugar`, and `protein` (CSP) values are skewed right, a (natural) log transformation was applied to them as part of building the imputation model. The untransformed values are later used as predictors when building the logistic regression and decision tree models to predict whether recipes will be high traffic or not.\n",
    "+ **category**: This a general categorical designation of the recipe. The data dictionary describes 10 categories. However, 11 categories where actually found in the original data:  \n",
    "*Beverages*, *Breakfast*, *Chicken*, *Chicken Breast <font color=\"red\">(not in data dictionary)</font>*, *Dessert*, *Lunch/Snacks*, *Meat*, *One Dish Meal*, *Pork*, *Potato*, *Vegetable*\n",
    "  + This is a categorical independent or predictor variable with 11 levels (described above).\n",
    "  + I decided not to combine the *Chicken* and *Chicken Breast* categories because the later was found (see EDA section) to correspond to a larger portion of the positive (**High**) class.\n",
    "  + Because this is a categorical variable with no oridinal relationship between the levels, they were one-hot encoded prior to creating the models.\n",
    "  + The space and / in categories like `Chicken Breast`, `Lunch/Snack` and `One Dish Meal` were removed for convenience in naming the encoded levels.\n",
    "+ **servings**: As defined by the [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/food/nutrition-facts-label/serving-size-nutrition-facts-label), a serving is a standard unit of measure based on the amount of food people typically consume\n",
    "  + This is a quantitative independent or predictor variable.\n",
    "  + Values for this variable are 1, 2, 4, and 6.\n",
    "  + Values were converted from strings to numbers (integers).\n",
    "  + Two values are listed as \"4 as a snack\" and one as \"6 as a snack\" in the original data. The *... as a snack* samples are dropped from the data for the following reasons:\n",
    "    1. The phrase *\"as a snack\"* typically implies somethings smaller than a normal *serving*, but by how much is ambiguous.\n",
    "    2. Out of 947 total, 3 samples represents less than 1/2 percent of the data.\n",
    "    3. This variable is not expected to be a strong predictor because recipe portions can be adjusted to make more or less, so it only serves to provide additional information.\n",
    "+ **high_traffic**: This is the target or the dependent variable we want to predict.\n",
    "  + Original data contains either the word *High* (positive class) or is a missing value (assumed to be the negative class).\n",
    "  + Because missing values are assumed to be the negative class, they were initally imputed as *NOT High*.\n",
    "  + Values were later converted from strings into binary values where: **1 = High traffic** and **0 = NOT High traffic**\n",
    "  + A little over 1/3 of the values are ***NOT High***, so no serious class imbalance exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data validation assumptions\n",
    "+ Although at least 376 samples have problematic values for `calories`, `carbohydrate`, `sugar`, and `protein`, the `category` and `high_traffic` columns are assumed to be accurate\n",
    "+ The `calories` column was assumed to be the only problem with the `calories`, `carbohydrate`, `sugar`, and `protein` group of variables, so the `calories` feature was dropped and the other 3 were retained.\n",
    "+ All the missing values in the `high_traffic` column are not actually missing values. They represent recipes that are **NOT** *High* traffic.\n",
    "+ The `Chicken` and `Chicken Breast` categories are mutually exclusive. In other words, all of the `Chicken` recipes use other parts of the chicken besides the breast meat (e.g. thighs, wings, drumsticks, etc.)\n",
    "+ The values for **calories**, **carbohydrate**, **sugar** and **protein** are listed **per serving** as described in the example provided with the data dictionary.\n"

    "If the `calories` data is truly per serving as is described in the example provided for this project, then 376 samples have inconsistencies in their `calories`, `carbohydrate`, `sugar`, and `protein` values. [There are roughly 4 calories per gram of carbohydrate, protein](https://www.nal.usda.gov/programs/fnic), or [sugar](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/169655/nutrients) according the USDA. If we add up the `carbohydrate`, `sugar`, and `protein` columns and multiply by 4, this value should be **less than the total calories shown in the calories column**. Unfortunately, there are 376 samples in the data where **the total calories per serving is less than the calories per serving from carbohydrate, sugar, and protein combined.** \n",

    "+ All provided data variables are positive.\n",
    "+ Samples values appear to be within a reasonable range.\n",
    "+ A few samples seem very high, but not extreme enough to justify dropping them."

    "## Missing Values\n",
    "\n",
    "As described above, we can see that there are 52 samples with missing values for `calories`, `carbohydrate`, `sugar` and `protein`. The matrix plot in the next cell and the code cell that follows it both validate that when any of these values are missing, the other 3 are missing as well. Missing values make up roughly 5.5% of the data. This is above the 5% threshold below which is typically considered acceptable to drop data. This means that imputation of the missing values will need to be done. The choice of imputation method is best informed by the type of missingness that characterizes the data and will be discussed in this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of missingness\n",
    "\n",
    "Before selecting an imputation method, the ***type of missingness*** needs to be determined. A description of each of these three types is shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Missing Completely at Random (MCAR)** - Data is MCAR when the probability of a value being missing is entirely independent of any observed or unobserved data (e.g., a sensor randomly fails).  \n",
    "2. **Missing at Random (MAR)** - Data is MAR when missingness is related to other observed variables but not to the missing value itself (e.g., men are less likely to report their weight, but weight missingness is explained by recorded gender).  \n",
    "3. **Missing Not at Random (MNAR)** - Data is MNAR when the reason for missingness is related to the missing value itself (e.g., people with high incomes refuse to report them). This is the most difficult type to handle because the data contains \"non-ignorable\" bias.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Distribution of missing values\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a sense of the type of missingness in the data, a good place to start is looking at how missing values are related to other variables. We see the following patterns in the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ The matrix plot shows that only the `calories`, `carbohydrate`, `sugar` and `protein` columns have missing values. It also suggests that when there are missing values, all 4 of these are missing at once. This observation is confirmed by counting all the samples that have **any** missing values and comparing this to the number of samples that have **all 4 of** these values missing. Since these counts are equal, we can be certain that all samples that have missing values also have all 4 of these values missing.\n",
    "+ Samples with `Beverage` or `Breakfast` categories don't have any missing values. In other words, missing values only occur in samples with the following categories:   `Chicken`, `Chicken Breast`, `Dessert`, `Lunch/Snacks`, `Meat`, `One Dish Meal`, `Pork`, `Potato`, `Vegetable`\n",
    "+ All the missing values in the `Pork`, `Potato` and `Vegetable` categories only occur in **High** traffic samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evidence for MCAR\n",
    "\n",
    "If missing values were *Missing Completely At Random*, we would expect to see missing values randomly distributed across all columns of the data. Instead, we only see missing values in four columns. We would also expect that the proportion of missing values in each category would be similar to the proportion of samples in each category in the overall data. Two observations suggest neither is the case:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The `Beverage` or `Breakfast` categories are the **1st** and **3rd** most frequent categories in the data, yet there are no missing values in samples from either of these categories.\n",
    "2. The number of missing values that are in the `Pork` category is over 2X the count of missing values in any other category.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evidence for MNAR\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no evidence that samples are Missing Not At Random.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evidence for MAR\n",
    "\n",
    "Running Chi-Squared tests for independence between:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `category` and ***missing (CCSP) values***\n",
    "2. `high_traffic` and ***missing (CCSP) values***\n",
    "\n",
    "both suggest that neither `category` or `high_traffic` are independent of ***missing (CCSP) values*** which implies that they are dependent. Although some of the expected counts in the `category` test are below 5 (requirement for Chi-Squared tests), all the evidence combined suggests that of the three types of missingness, the data is most likely **MAR**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Details regarding how the data was imputed will be described at the beginning of the **Model Development**."

    "## Data validation summary\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data provided contained 947 rows (samples) with each row representing a recipe.\n",
    "2. No duplicate recipes were found.\n",
    "3. Each row contained 8 columns (features): `recipe, calories, carbohydrate, sugar, protein, category, servings` and `high_traffic`\n",
    "4. Each row represents a recipe and is identified by a unique number from 1 to 947 in the `recipe` column. No cleaning of this column was required.\n",
    "5. The `calories` column was assumed to be the total calories per serving. These values were inconsistent with the `carbohydrate`, `sugar`, and `protein` columns in that 40% of the samples had more calories from (carbohydrates + sugar + protein) than there were total calories. This column was dropped from consideration as a feature in this analysis because of the inconsistency.\n",
    "6. The `carbohydrate`, `sugar`, and `protein` columns are numbers representing the grams of each per serving in each recipe. Missing data for these values occurred as a group where all 3 of these values were either all present or all 3 were missing.  There were 52 rows/samples where these values were missing representing 5.5% of the data. Because missing values exceeded 5%, these values were imputed in the **Model Development** section.\n",
    "7. To select an appropriate imputation method, the type of missingness needed to be determined. The strongest evidence for the missing data in the `carbohydrate`, `sugar`, and `protein` columns is that it is **Missing at Random (MAR)**.\n",
    "8. The `category` columns represent the recipe type. The project documentation listed 10 unique categories, but 11 were found in the data. The ***Chicken Breast*** was not listed in the documentation and was assumed to be mutually exclusive of the ***Chicken*** category. <font color=\"red\"><b>This assumption should be confirmed by the team.</b></font>. No cleaning of this column was required, but they were one-hot encoded just prior to model building.\n",
    "9. The `servings` column contained the following string values: \"1\", \"2\", \"4\", \"6\", \"4 as a snack\", and \"6 as a snack\". Three samples contained the phrase \"as a snack\". These samples were dropped because they represented less the 0.5% of the data. The remaining values were converted to a number (integer).\n",
    "10. The `high_traffic` column is the target variable we are modeling. It contained either a sting value **High** or was empty (missing value). The missing values were assumed to be recipes that were **not** high traffic and were replaced with the string **NOT High**.  The **High** and **NOT High** values were later encoded as 1 and 0 respectively just prior to model building.\n",
    "11. The `high_traffic` target showed mild class imbalance which informed the model development metric."
